# [MonoGame Book Examples](https://github.com/groundh0g/MonoGame-CodeCamps-Book-Examples)

Examples from my 2016 book, [MonoGame: Code Camps](http://codetopia.com/book/codecamps/).

A new book on cross-platform game programming [using MonoGame](https://github.com/mono/MonoGame) to replace [my 2007 XNA book](http://amzn.to/1JuxvD8). Examples from this book are inspired by [my annual game programming camp](http://codetopia.com/camps/index.html) in [Banner Elk, NC](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Banner+Elk,+NC+28604/@36.1567804,-81.872516,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x88508d56395ba3f1:0x4d2442b0fcfa987a).

I've been teaching teens and tweens to write games since 2011. This will be the text for that class moving forward.
